# Tyme Assignment Interview

### What have you done so far?

- Create a simple ReactJS SPA.
- Fetch sample data from a mocked API online free service.
- On first load, fetch and display data.
- Set a timer to reload new data every 60 seconds.
- Ability to search (search string in item Title and item Description only)
- Ability to filter (only implemented filter on `stock` property of the item)
- Focus entirely on the body part of the page to showcase JS skill. Ignored the Header and Footer and unnecessary styling.
- The page is responsive basically with mobile and `md` desktop breakpoints. **Tailwindcss** is used.
- `See more` feature to load more data when clicked. Each time it loads eight items.
- Used `flex` for general layout and `grid` for the "items" listing.
- Used `lodash` just for quick-kill.
- Use internal state to keep data.

### What are some improvement/ missing pieces you would like to do if you have more time?

- Finish the Header
- Finish the Footer
- Separate into smaller components instead of everything inside one big component. I sacrificed this for speed to finish the test.
- Add some Jest test
- Proper styling
- Clean up code
- Use some proper external state management system, especially when divided into multiple small components
- Divide utils code into separated .ts module and import when needed
- Some `lodash` functions can be rewritten to just vanillaJS to reduce dependencies.

### How many hours you actually spent finishing the assignment?

- About `5 hours` continuously, but span across 2 days because of other multiple workload aside.
